      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My recent research focuses on advancing **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal AI, and Human-AI Interaction** to tackle impactful challenges in science, health, and accessibility.

        I have worked on:
        - **Neuro-symbolic models** for American Sign Language (ASL) understanding, achieving high performance in isolated sign recognition and laying the groundwork for phoneme-to-sign pipelines.
        - Developing **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** systems and Chain-of-Query prompting techniques to enhance reasoning in LLMs.
        - **Chatbot dialog design for improved human performance in domain knowledge discovery**, optimizing conversational AI to facilitate efficient knowledge retrieval, enhance user engagement, and support domain-specific learning.
        - Applying **explainable AI (XAI)** in healthcare, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) eye-tracking classification using cutting-edge models like Vision Transformers.

        Through my research, I strive to bridge the gap between humans and AI by creating solutions that are inclusive, transparent, and impactful. Collaboration fuels progress, so letâ€™s connect and build something amazing together! ðŸš€ðŸ˜ƒ
