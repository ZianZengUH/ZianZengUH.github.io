# ICS 496 - Capstone Project
## Introduction
### Problem:
When instructors have large class sizes, it is very difficult for them to maintain the integrity of their classroom during quizzes.  Our Quiz App intends to help alleviate this issue by utilizing the instructor’s and student’s Wi-fi connection to the same network, pictures taken by the student in class, IP logging, and other technologies to prevent students from taking the quiz at home or attempting to cheat.


### Our Solution:
Quiz App is a cross-platform app that consists a desktop version for the instructor and a mobile version for the students. It uses singleton WebSocket + GPS verification via LAN for connection and real-time data transfer which help to track attendance and dissuade cheating while students take quizzes for ICS and other departments at the University of Hawaii at Manoa
